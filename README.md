# congenial-spoon: A guess the number game. 

Written in C++ with Xcode 12 for Mac OSX and Visual Studio 2019 for Windows 10.

This is a nice project to force me to learn the basics of C++. 

The user is asked to enter an integer from 0 to 100. 

I used Regular Expressions, function definitions, header files, types, if-else statements, and other basic concepts to implement this program.

# Files:
* main.cpp: Contains the main() function with the main loop.
* checkAndProcessInput.cpp: Contains the custom functions called by the main loop. These functions check the user input to main sure they are integers between 0 and 100. 
* checkAndProcessInput.hpp: Header files with the forward declarations of all the functions inside checkAndProcessInput.cpp. 



Comments, issues, and grooming advice are welcome. You do this through the "Issues" section of this repository. 

This is very self explanatory so I will not create a Wiki for this repo. :)
