A guess the number game. Written in C++ with Xcode. 

This is a nice project to force me to learn the basics of C++. 

The user is asked to enter an integer from 0 to 100. 

I used Regular Expressions, function definitions, header files, types, and other basic concepts to implement this program.

# Files:
* main.cpp: Contains the main() function with the main loop.
* checkAndProcessInput.cpp: Contains the custom functions called by the main loop. These functions check the user input to main sure they are integers between 0 and 100. 
* checkAndProcessInput.hpp: Header files with the forward declarations of all the functions inside checkAndProcessInput.cpp.
